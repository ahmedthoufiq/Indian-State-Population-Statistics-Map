# Indian-State-Population-Statistics-Map
Created an interactive map which shows the population statastics of each and every state when clicked or searched in the search Bar.

This is a basic WebGIS application meant to represent and engage with Indian state boundaries. Developed with Leaflet.js, the project illustrates the incorporation of geospatial data into a web platform through simple frontend development capabilities. The main aim is to mimic a lightweight GIS dashboard experience where users are able to browse geographic and demographic data through a simple, interactive interface.
The app contains an interactive map that shows Indian state borders with GeoJSON information. When a state is clicked, a popup will be shown with the name of the state, and the map zooms in to mark the chosen location. A responsive panel on the side contains useful data, including the number of states, five randomly selected states, and their respective dummy population counts. This provides a dynamic feel and mimics actual data visualization, although the population values are hardcoded or randomly assigned.
part from the interactive map, the app has a search bar that enables users to locate and highlight a particular state by entering its name. If a state is discovered, the map would automatically zoom into it, and its name and dummy population are shown in the sidebar for easy reference.

Technically, the project was developed with HTML for the structure, CSS (with Bootstrap) for layout and styling, and JavaScript for managing user interactions and logic. Leaflet.js forms the core of rendering the map and overlaying GeoJSON data, as well as providing interactive functionality like zooming, highlighting, and popups. The overall layout is crafted using Flexbox and Bootstrap's grid system to make it look tidy and run smoothly on desktop and laptop displays. Although the interface is PC-optimized, complete mobile responsiveness is currently in progress and might require further progress.

Tools and Libraries Used:
I used a combination of web and open-source library technologies to construct this WebGIS application. HTML formed the base to organize the webpage, with CSS—alongside Bootstrap support—to style the design and produce a clean and readable interface. Bootstrap assisted in achieving a responsive grid and flex layout, particularly to arrange map and sidebar contents side by side.
JavaScript was responsible for introducing interactivity to the page, ranging from managing search functionality to dynamically changing content in the sidebar. In the mapping component, I utilized Leaflet.js, a light-weight open-source JavaScript library used specifically for creating web maps. Leaflet made it simple to load GeoJSON data, display interactive layers, and manage map behaviors such as zooming, panning, and fitting views. I also optionally used Chart.js to visualize population data, although the main focus was on interactive map functionality.
The India state borders were initialized using a GeoJSON file that was either downloaded locally or referenced from an external GitHub source. Overall, the tools helped speed up the development process while supporting powerful geographic data visualization using a web browser.

Working on this project helped me learn how to integrate spatial data and frontend libraries to create an interactive and informative user interface. I learned how to utilize Leaflet.js to display and handle geospatial data on a map, including adding popups, zooming views on a clicked feature, and styling GeoJSON layers. It was also my first experience creating a sidebar that dynamically responds to a map interface, allowing users to see detailed information through their interactions.
Most significant, perhaps, was that this exercise showed me how spatial information can be converted into effective visuals and how user interfaces can be designed to display such information in a consumable manner, especially in education or civic applications. It made me feel comfortable with integrating geographic information systems with frontend technologies and made me look forward to designing more advanced WebGIS platforms in the future.
